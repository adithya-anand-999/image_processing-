# image_processing
Client-side web application built using JavaScript, p5.js, and dat.GUI, demonstrating a range of image processing techniques. Features include brightness, contrast, saturation, Box blur, Gaussian blur, edge detection, sharpen, and dithering techniques. 

# compiling 
Clone the repository to your local machine and execute 'npm run dev' in your terminal. This command will start a local Vite server, and its address will be displayed in the terminal. Navigate to this address to view the initial image, monalisa.jpg, and control panel. The panel lets you apply various processing algorithms and includes a reset button to return to the original image.


# upcoming features
Allow users to input their own images easily from the frontend \n
Allow users to download images after applying changes
Add a toggle to allow image processing changes to compound, meaning multiple changes beyond pixel operations can be seen together
